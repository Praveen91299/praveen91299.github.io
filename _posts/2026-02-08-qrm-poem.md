title: "Excerpt From My Undergraduate Thesis"
---

*In this age of mighty empires  
Wander not beyond loyal bounds  
Lest a spell befall onto thy head  
To flip your loyalties forever*

*Amidst the chaos and division  
In the depths but omnipresent  
Therein lies hidden loyal ears  
Threads of fabric spun across empires*  

*Of these men their will wielded  
By woeful masters of empires within  
A hierarchy fractal fragile to wind  
A thin gossamer shared amidst.*  


This poem was written in 2021, split across the chapters of my undergraduate thesis. In the thesis, I explored the structure and entanglement present in Quantum Reed Muller codes to propose efficient encoders for the same.
